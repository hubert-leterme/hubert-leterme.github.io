I attended the [EUSICPO 2024](https://eusipcolyon.sciencesconf.org/) conference in Lyon. It was nice catching up with Kévin Polisano and Valérie Perrier, my former colleagues and advisors from Grenoble! On Wednesday 28th, I presented our accepted paper, "From CNNs to Shift-Invariant Twin Models Based on Complex Wavelets."
