I spent the week in Edinburgh attending the <a href='https://www.icms.org.uk/UQIPI24'>UQIPI24 Workshop on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Inverse Problems and Imaging</a>. I had the opportunity to present a poster about distribution-free UQ. I spent a great time there and engaged in constructive discussions with several people, in particular Julian Tachella, RÃ©mi Laumont and Barbara Pascal.
