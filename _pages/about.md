I am a postdoctoral researcher in astrostatistics at <a href='https://www.ensicaen.fr/?lang=en'>ENSICAEN</a> institute of technology (Caen, France) and <a href='https://www.cea.fr/english'>CEA Paris-Saclay</a> (Paris metropolitan area, France), under the supervision of <a href='https://fadili.users.greyc.fr/'>Jalal Fadili</a> (ENSICAEN) and <a href='https://jstarck.cosmostat.org/'>Jean-Luc Starck</a> (CEA). My research is part of the [the TOSCA project](https://tosca.cosmostat.org/), focusing on weak lensing statistics for cosmology, which explores the synergies between Euclid and SKAO.
<!-- TOSCA is a collaboration between three French laboratories (the Astrophysics Division at CEA Paris-Saclay, the GREYC research institute in Caen and the Nice-Côte d'Azur Observatory) and the University of Geneva (Switzerland). -->
My work will contribute to the reconstruction of mass maps from radio shear measurements using deep learning techniques, with a specific emphasis on uncertainty quantification.

I completed my PhD in June 2023 at the <a href='https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/'>University of Grenoble Alpes</a> and <a href='https://team.inria.fr/thoth/'>Inria (Thoth team)</a>, supervised by [Valérie Perrier](https://membres-ljk.imag.fr/Valerie.Perrier), [Karteek Alahari](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/alahari), and [Kévin Polisano](https://www.kevinpolisano.com). My research lied at the intersection between computer vision and image processing, with a focus on convolutional neural networks, wavelets and stochastic signal processing.

Before my PhD, I received an engineering degree (MSc) from [CentraleSupelec, University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), with a focus on industrial engineering, supply chain management, and operations research. After a few years working in the industry, including a two-year experience in Sweden, I decided to take a 180 degree turn and to embark in the research adventure. This brought me to Grenoble in 2018, where I received a MSc degree in industrial and applied mathematics from the University of Grenoble Alpes and [Grenoble INP Institute of Engineering and Management](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/en).
